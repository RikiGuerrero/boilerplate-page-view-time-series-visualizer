# 📈 Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is an exercise from the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** course.  
It uses **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to visualize forum page view data from freeCodeCamp.org (2016–2019).  

The project produces:  
- A **line plot** showing daily page views.  
- A **bar plot** showing monthly averages grouped by year.  
- **Box plots** showing yearly trends and monthly seasonality.  

The dataset is cleaned by removing the top and bottom 2.5% of page views before visualization.  
Unit tests in `test_module.py` are included to validate the solutions.
